# Enhance Divergence Mod

[Divergence](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/divergence/) gets so cool appearance.

## What does this addon do

Once this addon simply reverted [this commit](https://github.com/artificialparanoia/Divergence/commit/50b524cdb07326fcb7ac9595551a217ae20f441b) of Divergence mod.
See [this issue](https://github.com/artificialparanoia/Divergence/issues/6) (BIG SPOILER of Divergence mod).

But, now, the appearance becomes better than that commit by many tuning.

## Thanks
