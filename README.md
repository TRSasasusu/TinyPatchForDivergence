# Enhance Divergence Mod

[Divergence](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/divergence/) gets so cool appearance again.

## What does this addon do

This addon simply reverts [this commit](https://github.com/artificialparanoia/Divergence/commit/50b524cdb07326fcb7ac9595551a217ae20f441b) of Divergence mod.
See [this issue](https://github.com/artificialparanoia/Divergence/issues/6) (BIG SPOILER of Divergence mod).

## Sorry

Sorry @artificialparanoia, but I cannot miss it. Sorry...
